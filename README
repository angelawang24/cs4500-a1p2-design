No longer using Jan Vitek's implementation.

The Object class and the String class are taken from https://piazza.com/class/k51bluky59n2jr?cid=345
to attempt to standardize those two objects for everyone in this class

Map class
The map copies on puts (both key and value).
Maps are a subclass of the Object class.
Keys are always objects of the Object class and values are all objects of the Object class.
The map has a default constructor that creates a map with no mappings and a copy constructor that takes in 
an existing map and copies it.
The map has a put method for putting new mappings of Object->Object or updating existing mappings in the map.
The map has a get method to get the value associated with a key.
The map can check if the map contains a value for a key.
We can remove a mapping from the map.
The map can tell you its size.
The map can create a clone of itself.
The map can provide the user with an array of its keys, not sorted.
Maps do not overwrite the Object's equals function. Maps should only be equal if they are the same object.
Maps also do not overwrite the Object's hashing function.
